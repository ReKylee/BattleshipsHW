# How to Compile and Run

---

### 🚨 **Important**:

**Run the program in an external terminal**, **not** in the IDE terminal.  
In my testing, the program did not display correctly in IDE terminals.

---

### 🖥️ For WSL/Ubuntu:

```bash
cd cmake-build-debug-wsl
cmake ..
./Catalog
```

---

### ⚙️ For MinGW:

```bash
cd cmake-build-debug-mingw
cmake ..
./Catalog.exe
```

# How to Compile and Run

### 🚨 **Important**:

**Run the program in an external terminal**, **not** in the IDE terminal.  
In my testing, the program did not display correctly in IDE terminals.

### 🖥️ For WSL/Ubuntu:

```bash
cd cmake-build-debug-wsl
cmake ..
./BattleshipsHW
```

### ⚙️ For MinGW:
